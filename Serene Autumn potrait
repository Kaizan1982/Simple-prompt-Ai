  "prompt": "A serene autumn scene, a young Javanese woman sits on a wooden park bench surrounded by maple trees with leaves falling. The woman has light brown hair and is wearing a Givenchy Autumn Dress. She is peacefully reading a book and smiling gently. The scene is softly lit with warm sunlight filtering through the mapel leaves falling, creating a dreamy and romantic atmosphere with a shallow depth of field and blurred mapel leaves falling in the foreground. The background shows a lush green park with a calm, bright ambiance.)(",
