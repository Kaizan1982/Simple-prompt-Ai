A close-up of a man wearing a heavily decorated oni god hannya mask with intricate silver details and decoration, featuring a red face with black eye holes. The man is dressed in elaborate black and red Japanese imperial armor with gold accents, and holds a finger to his lips in a "silence" gesture. He is leaning slightly forward and his head is slightly tilted. The background is blurred, highlighting the mask and clothing.( The shot is low angle, soft+bokeh and cinematic. The image includes subtle little text and transparent in the bottom left corner, using font [gabrliya] that reads "JudasIscariots"
