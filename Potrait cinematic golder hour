A portrait cinematic of a beautiful young javanese woman with lights brown, tousled hair styled in a messy bun with loose strands framing her face [use reference photo]. She has fair skin with subtle, soft lips, and expressive eyes, gazing slightly upward and with both hands up as if she was fixing her bun. She is wearing a cozy, ivory-colored turtleneck sweater by designer Crishtian Dior. The warm, golden hour lighting backlights her, creating a glowing halo effect around her hair and illuminating her face with a soft, warm glow. The background is blurred with a natural, outdoor setting, possibly a maple or meadow, with muted tones that complement her attire and the lighting. The overall mood of the image is serene, warm, and contemplative.)
