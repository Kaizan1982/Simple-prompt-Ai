  "prompt": "A beautiful portrait of a javanese  woman surrounded by soft white Camellia flowers. She has light brown hair styled in a loose, elegant bun, and she wears a cream or ivory pastel siphon dress that reflects the sun's light. The atmosphere is ethereal and romantic, with warm natural lighting and a soft, shallow depth of field that blurs the foreground blossoms into delicate white bokeh. The background is a gentle blue sky, enhancing the contrast with the white tones. The overall mood is serene, feminine, and poetic, evoking the feeling of spring and beauty.))",
